    "text": "Methodology\nIn collaboration with Who Targets Me, we monitored 584 political advertisers in Greece during the 2nd 2023 Greek legislative election to better understand how campaigns use different targeting methods made available by Meta. To do this, we used data from the Meta Ad Library, using the new ‚ÄòAudience‚Äô data which gives some detail on how pages target their ads.\nTo better understand the election, we kept only advertisers who:\n\nAdvertised in the last 7 days (Jun 11th - Jun 17th 2023)\nAdvertised in the last 30 days (May 19th - Jun 17th 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMeta only provides 7, 30 and 90 days windows for the targeting data in their Ad Library. Meta‚Äôs data also lags by a few days. Report will be updated as soon as new data is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\nThe data shown in this dashboard is based on the platform‚Äôs respective ad libraries which are known to be sometimes incomplete (Edelson et al.¬†2020; Silva et al.¬†2020). For this reason the data shown here might not reflect the full picture nor all political ads that were targeted at voters.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Creators of the Dashboard\n\nFabio VottaAlexandros Gotinakos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabio Votta is a Ph.D. candidate in Political Communication at the University of Amsterdam who studies (online) political microtargeting and its usage around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexandros Gotinakos is a predoctoral researcher for the ActEU project at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
